# UPDATE LOG — THE CODEX OF GIZA

What changed in each update, newest first. The version number matches
`GAME_VERSION` in `data.js` (shown on both title screens).

**Rule:** every game-changing update bumps `GAME_VERSION` and adds an entry
here *in the same commit*.

Other docs:
- `MASTER_LORE_BIBLE.md` — the story / world lore (source of truth).
- `NEW_CHARACTERS.md` — voice + agenda for the expansion NPCs.
- `3D_CONVERSION_NOTES.md` — what the 3D branch is, how it's built, quirks.

## V3.1.1 — 2026-08-03
- WebGL startup now retries with lighter settings (no antialias, etc.)
  before giving up, so weaker GPUs/browsers can still run the 3D build.

## V3.1.0 — 2026-08-03
- Added a shared `GAME_VERSION`, shown on both the 3D and 2D title screens.
- Boot guard: if startup fails, the game explains why instead of showing
  a silent black screen.
- Main menu overhauled into a cinematic title screen.
- Menu "Site Overview" drone viewer; fixed tent roof; dig-gate label repaint.
