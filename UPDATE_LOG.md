# UPDATE LOG — THE CODEX OF GIZA

What changed in each update, newest first. The version number matches
`GAME_VERSION` in `data.js` (shown on both title screens).

**Rule:** every game-changing update bumps `GAME_VERSION` and adds an entry
here *in the same commit*.

Other docs:
- `MASTER_LORE_BIBLE.md` — the story / world lore (source of truth).
- `NEW_CHARACTERS.md` — voice + agenda for the expansion NPCs.
- `3D_CONVERSION_NOTES.md` — what the 3D branch is, how it's built, quirks.

## V3.4.0 — 2026-09-29 — Title screen, prologue, settings, ambience, feel
- **New title screen** (`title3d.js`, `ui3d.css`): it opens on a letterboxed
  "PRESS ANY KEY" splash over slow cinematic shots of the night camp that cut
  through black (the festooned tent, the tunnel seal, the brazier, the pyramids,
  the trench). There's a seal emblem (the Tunnel Gate Seal's four stones round a
  core) whose core pings every 8 seconds with a low tone, like the Codex in
  Ellis's tent. The menu is a left-aligned PC-style list you can use with the
  mouse or ↑/↓ + Enter: Continue (shows chapter and when you saved), New
  Excavation (asks before overwriting a save), Settings, Site Overview.
- **Prologue on a new game:** place/time cards over black ("Giza Plateau,
  Egypt / Autumn, 2023 / The twenty-second night of the excavation."), then one
  establishing shot descending onto the lamplit tent, then the game's own
  opening fades in as before. ESC or Enter skips it. No story text changed.
- **Settings screen** (`settings.js`), from the title and from the pause menu,
  saved in the browser. Graphics: quality preset (Low/Medium/High/Ultra —
  resolution, shadows, dust), brightness, field of view. Controls: mouse
  sensitivity, invert Y, key list. Audio: master, ambience, footsteps.
  Gameplay: object labels (nearby/always/off), controls reminder, head bob,
  reduce motion (calms the low-sanity camera sway/tremor).
- **Ambient sound** (`ambience.js`, Ch1): synthesized gusting desert wind, the
  brazier crackling as you get close, the generator's diesel hum, crickets.
- **Mechanics / feel:**
  - Interaction now picks what you're looking at when several things are in
    reach. The prompt names it ("SPACE  TARIQ"), and there's a small crosshair
    that lights up on a target. **F** also interacts.
  - Fixed: pressing SPACE during a minigame could re-open its dialogue.
  - Walking eases in and out (same top speed), with a small sprint FOV kick
    and a camera dip when you land a jump.
  - HUD restyled: a compact sanity/funds panel, and a thin stamina bar at the
    bottom centre that fades out when it's full and turns red when you're low.
  - The ministry car is now a proper black saloon facing the way it drives,
    with its headlights on.
- Pause menu: new Settings button, and the footer shows the real version.

## V3.3.0 — 2026-09-29 — Ch1 minigames played in the world
Both Chapter 1 minigames now play in 3D in the actual place, like a PC game
instead of a flat pop-up card. Rules, flags, records and story scenes are unchanged.
- **The Tunnel Gate Seal:** the camera steps up to the stela. Mouse over the real
  glyph stones and click to press them (or use keys 1–4). Pressed stones sink and light up.
  The resonance timer is a ring of beads around the seal, and the core pings every
  8 seconds like the Codex. A wrong stone fires the cedar trap dart out of the rock into
  the timber brace, the screen shakes, and the stones grind round to new positions.
  Solving it spins the ring. Right-click or ESC steps back.
- **Camp Darts:** first person at the throwing line. Aim with the mouse against
  natural hand sway. Hold the left button to steady your breath (the view tightens
  and a breath bar shows how steady you are), but hold too long and your arm shakes.
  Release to throw. Darts fly, stick in the board and stay there. Score popups appear
  at the board. The result panel has Throw Again (R) / Walk Away (ESC).
- The seal stela was rebuilt to match its description: a pale ring, a dark amber core,
  four glyph stones at the compass points, and a timber brace for the trap.
- The dartboard's rings now match the scoring zones. Sam's chalk "S — 132" is on the plank.
- The 2D build still uses the original 2D versions.

## V3.2.0 — 2026-09-29 — Chapter 1 camp visual overhaul
The first open area (the Giza dig camp, up to the Tunnel Gate Seal) was
rebuilt visually from scratch. No story, dialogue, flags or collision changed.
- New files: `ch1_world.js` (terrain, sky, lighting, FX) and `ch1_props.js`
  (buildings, props, fences, vehicles). The old Ch1 art code was removed
  from `engine3d.js`.
- Lighting: moonlight with soft shadows, tone mapping, warm lamp pools with
  glow halos. It reads as night but you can still see where you're going.
- Sky: a shader sky with twinkling stars, the Milky Way, thin moonlit cloud
  and Cairo's glow on the horizon. The moon has craters. The Giza pyramids
  and distant city lights sit on the horizon.
- Terrain: rolling dunes out to the horizon, trodden paths and tyre-rutted
  roads, a bulldozed berm around the site edge (so the invisible border
  walls have a visible reason), and a rock escarpment across the north.
  The east trench is now actually dug, with ramps, shoring, planks and spoil.
- Buildings: a canvas wall tent with a porch and a lit interior, a timber
  bunkhouse with a water tank and a washing line, a plastered mud-brick site
  office, and ministry portakabins. The Tunnel is now a timbered portal cut
  into the rock, with a rock-cut approach.
- Props: every prop was remade (trucks, SUVs, generator, mine carts, braziers,
  scaffolding, palms, cacti, ruins, etc.). Added festoon lights, pennant rope
  fences, chain-link fences with signs, and a wheelbarrow, bowser and survey grid.
- FX: a real brazier fire with embers and smoke, drifting sand, moths
  around the work lamps, swaying palms and flags, and a sleeping, breathing Dust.
- Characters (all chapters): rounded limbs, faces, boots and better headwear.
  Same rig and animations as before.
- Labels: restyled as small gold-trimmed tags. In Ch1 they only show up close.
- Physical things (trench, generator, carts, stela…) no longer vanish once
  their story beat is done. Only the label and the interaction go away.

## V3.1.1 — 2026-08-03
- WebGL startup now retries with lighter settings (no antialias, etc.)
  before giving up, so weaker GPUs/browsers can still run the 3D build.

## V3.1.0 — 2026-08-03
- Added a shared `GAME_VERSION`, shown on both the 3D and 2D title screens.
- Boot guard: if startup fails, the game explains why instead of showing
  a silent black screen.
- Main menu overhauled into a cinematic title screen.
- Menu "Site Overview" drone viewer; fixed tent roof; dig-gate label repaint.
